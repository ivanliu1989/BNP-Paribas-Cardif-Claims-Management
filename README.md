test different combinations of summing NA, 0, nan... until you finally see an improvement.

Between train and test, there are 23.419 distinct values for v22, and the last one is AHPT, so if: A = 1, H = 8, P = 16 and T = 20 in a Hexavigesimal base, the translation to decimal would be: 1 * (26 ** 3) + 8 * (26 ** 2) + 16 * (26 ** 1) + 20 * (26 ** 0) = 23.420 witch is off by 1, but it seams pretty consistent anyway. If I am correct, v22 includes all posible 2 and 3 letter combinations, witch in turn should include a lot of companies initials, and also all of the three letter agencies, so we might have to tread lightly.
